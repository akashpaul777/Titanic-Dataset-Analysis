# Titanic Data Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook performs an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring the factors affecting passenger survival. The analysis follows a structured data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development.

## Data Science Pipeline
The notebook follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Import necessary libraries  
   - Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (e.g., filling missing ages using median or predictive imputation)  
   - Convert categorical features into numerical values (e.g., encoding 'Sex' and 'Embarked')  
   - Remove or modify outliers  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generate descriptive statistics  
   - Visualize survival rates based on different features (e.g., age, gender, class)  
   - Correlation analysis using heatmaps and pair plots  

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features (e.g., family size, cabin section)  
   - Normalize or scale numerical data if necessary  

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)  
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

6. **Predictions & Conclusions**  
   - Make predictions on test data  
   - Summarize findings and key takeaways
